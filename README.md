Reflection:

This prototype is reflective of the game loop we were trying to represent. The AI for the guards works exactly as we had hoped and provides a good challenge for the player.
Unfortunately, since the walls do not work, the game does not play out exactly as we had hoped but the idea still comes across.

Our question was whether or not the game is challenging when you combine the maze element with the guard chasing you, and I think it is. The lack of walls skews how the game is played
but it is still capable of being played as intended. 

The change I would make is that with functioning walls, I think more guards would be good for the challenge of the game considering how large the map is. Without the walls, however, the 
extra guards become inconsequential because they will walk through the walls long before they present a challenge to the player.

Camdyn and I workshopped this idea from one of my concepts from the beginning of the year and one of the other gameplay elements we left out that I would like to add in the future is that 
it is a competitive multiplayer game where multiple people are attempting to escape all at once, but only one can make it out. This would lead to players sabotaging each other in order to put themselves ahead.
